            <h3 className="subheader text-center">WELCOME TO OUR BLOG</h3>
            <div className="clearfix">
                <img src={blog} className="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="..." />
                <p>
                    A paragraph of placeholder text.We're using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image.Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at.It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content.A joke, perhaps.Unfortunately, there's none of that here.

                    <p>What began as a surgical treatment for prostate cancer has now become the Bumrungrad Robotic Surgery Center. It utilizes state-of-the-art technologies for robotic-assisted surgery such as MAKOplasty©, Mazor X and the da Vinci System to allow for more consistency, accuracy and faster recovery times with less invasiveness for joint, spine and cancer patients.</p>
                    <p>In order to remain a leader in cutting-edge technology, Bumrungrad was the first IBM Watson for Oncology site in the world. IBM Watson, a machine-learning AI, assists physicians by analyzing patient data against thousands of historical cases, hundreds of medical journals and textbooks, the latest clinical trials, and more than 12 million pages of text. This innovation in technology allows doctors and specialists to compare their findings against big data and provide the most accurate treatments possible.</p>
                    <p>Bumrungrad International Hospital is a leader in medical technology and innovative patient services. Among the most recent advancements, Bumrungrad has expanded the Precision Medicine department which offers personalized cancer treatments and the latest breakthrough therapies mostly from the United States and Europe. Another cutting-edge technology we use is CardioInsight, a completely non-invasive diagnostics technology for diagnosing heart arrhythmias and the only active center in the Asia Pacific.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheader">Innovation and Technology</h3>
                    <p>What began as a surgical treatment for prostate cancer has now become the Bumrungrad Robotic Surgery Center. It utilizes state-of-the-art technologies for robotic-assisted surgery such as MAKOplasty©, Mazor X and the da Vinci System to allow for more consistency, accuracy and faster recovery times with less invasiveness for joint, spine and cancer patients.</p>
                    <p>In order to remain a leader in cutting-edge technology, Bumrungrad was the first IBM Watson for Oncology site in the world. IBM Watson, a machine-learning AI, assists physicians by analyzing patient data against thousands of historical cases, hundreds of medical journals and textbooks, the latest clinical trials, and more than 12 million pages of text. This innovation in technology allows doctors and specialists to compare their findings against big data and provide the most accurate treatments possible.</p>
                    <p>Bumrungrad International Hospital is a leader in medical technology and innovative patient services. Among the most recent advancements, Bumrungrad has expanded the Precision Medicine department which offers personalized cancer treatments and the latest breakthrough therapies mostly from the United States and Europe. Another cutting-edge technology we use is CardioInsight, a completely non-invasive diagnostics technology for diagnosing heart arrhythmias and the only active center in the Asia Pacific.</p>
